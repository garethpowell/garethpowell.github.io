                        Gaz has been part of Mosaic Islandâ€™s story from the very beginning of the Columbus journey.
                            He first contributed as an MI associate on the original implementation back in 2010, before
                            officially joining as an employee in January 2013 when the team relocated from London to
                            Bristol and we opened the Rombourne office in Aztec West. That adds up to an incredible 15
                            years of service to Mosaic Island.<br/><br/>

                        Over those years, Gaz has played a central role and has made a huge impact on our delivery,
                            our teams, and our clients. Rather than try to list all of his achievements here (there are
                            far too many!), I want to take this opportunity to thank Gaz for his outstanding
                            contribution, and to say personally that I will greatly miss working with him each day as
                            both a colleague and
                            a friend.

                            It's been a long journey in which you have played a fabulous role. So many nights out in
                            London to remember.
